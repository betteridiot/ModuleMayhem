    "One of the most infuriating things one can come across when coding is finding that *perfect package* that is supposed to do exactly what you need, but when you go to use it there is **NO documentation**! This is such a pet peeve of mine, that it has become a personal quest to make sure every inch of my code is annotated. This is when a seasoned programmer will ask \"what kind of documentation are we talking about?\"\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "See, there are essentially 3-4 different types of documentation. The first is inline comments. These are meant for *you* as a developer to remind yourself why that code exists. These are not really meant for the consumers of your code. \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "The second type of documentation is docstrings. These are the handy little descriptions that you type right after your shebang (`#!`) line or right after a function/class declaration. Docstrings are meant for a number of things, be it a brief summary of the function, descriptions of your arguments, potential errors, and returned/yielded values. Docstrings can also house brief code usage examples that are actually ***testable*** using the `doctest` function on the command line. \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "The third kind of documentation is actual online readable docs in the form of a web page or PDF. While this kind of documentation is **extremely** helpful, it actually doens't require a whole lot of effort because of tools like `Sphinx` which will autogenerate documentation based on how you have written your docstrings. Cool, huh?\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "The last form of documentation is your command line interface (CLI) help prompt (this is the stuff that comes up if you type *`command --help`*). Yes, almost **every** python program starts as CLI. Funny enough, most of the mainstream tools we use tend to have very elaborate help prompts (e.g. EVERY linux binary, samtools, bedtools, etc.) However, as developers, we often overlook this essential first step. This is where **`docopt`** comes into play."

    "Now, there are two frames of thought when composing your help prompt. One, and the most readily used, is the `argparse`/`click`/`begins` method, which explains each piece of the CLI and does argument handling via verbose script, but with the added benefit that is automatically compiles your help message based on how you have described your variable. An `argparse` example can be seen below:"

They even allow you to type in a help description that will show when you type `--help`. But this kind of setup means you have to type every single argument/option just like this, and that isn't counting things like sub-commands, mutually exclusive commands, positional vs keyword arguments, etc. \n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "However, the other school of thought is to write your help message (as you would like it to look) and a parser will do all the rest of the work for you. This is the `docopt` way.\n",

There are two things to keep in mind when using `docopt` though, the first is that you **must** use spaces, not `'\\t'` (tabs) to write your help prompt or else the parser will inaccurately parse your CL arguments. The second is that the help prompt must be entered right after you shebang (`#!`) line--as part of your docstring! "
